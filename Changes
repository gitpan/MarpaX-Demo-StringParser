Revision history for Perl extension MarpaX::Demo::StringParser.

1.08  Wed Sep 17 16:58:00 2014
	- Update Build.PL and Makefile.PL re putting this package on github.
	- Replace the deprecated 'action_object' parameter to Marpa::R2::Scanless::G with the 'semantics_package'
		parameter to Marpa::R2::Scanless::R.

1.07  Sat Feb 22 17:44:00 2014
	- Add 'lexeme default = latm => 1' to the grammar.
	- Make V 2.082 the minimum version for Marpa::R2.

1.06  Tue Jan 14 15:58:00 2014
	- Fix a typo in one of the samples in the docs:
		Old: -> {label: Start} -> {color: red} [node.1] {color: green] -> [node.2]
		New: -> {label: Start} -> {color: red} [node.1] {color: green} -> [node.2]
	- Add data/graph.04.ge, which is just a combination of samples from the docs.
	- Add installation instructions to the docs.
	- Remove 'use open qw(:std :utf8)' and 'use charnames qw(:full :short)' from all modules.
		'use open' is global (i.e. applies to /all/ modules), and I don't use any charnames.
		It does mean you have to use 'use open qw(:std :utf8)' in any scripts calling this code,
		if that's what you want to do.
	- Switch from bareword file handles to lexically-named file handles. This stop these types of msgs:
		Use of bareword filehandle in open at lib/MarpaX/Demo/StringParser.pm line 472.

1.05  Mon Jul 29 14:42:00 2013
	- Simplify the code in Actions.pm.
	- Add Marpa's homepage to the FAQ.
	- Fix the description in the FAQ where it described the grammar parsed as a version of DOT when it's actually
		a version of Graph::Easy::Marpa.
	- Add data/edge.06.* and html/edge.06.svg to demonstrate juxtaposition of edges without spaces.
	- Patch MarpaX::Demo::StringParser::Utils to call get_files() from MarpaX::Demo::StringParser::Filer, now
		that that method has been shifted out of *::Utils.
	- Clean up the docs in various ways.

1.04  Fri Jul 26 09:47:00 2013
	- Remove hard-coded temp dir name from t/ge2tokens.t, which was left over from testing the testing code.
	- Move sub edge() from Actions.pm into StringParser.pm, because it's never called by Marpa as an action.
		It was left in Actions.pm to simplify my switching back-and-forth between actions and pauses as I
		studied the behaviour of these 2 mechanisms.
	- Document that my usage of pauses is more of an intermediate/advanced usage rather than something for
		beginners.
	- Re-write docs where lexing and parsing is discussed, vis-a-vis the Marpa view of processing.
		This re-write also applies to the accompanying article mentioned in the docs.
	- Expand docs describing the methods. Some methods were not included in previous documentation.

1.03  Thu Jul 25 12:10:00 2013
	- Remove Regexp::Common from being 'use'd by MarpaX::Demo::StringParser. It was not used.
	- Add File::Temp to the pre-reqs.

1.02  Wed Jul 24 13:05:00 2013
	- Split Utils into Filer and Utils. The former does not use the config file.
		The test code used Utils, which loaded Config, which looked for a config file only installed on
		the authors PC.
	- Fix typo in die in sub process():
		Was: Unexpected lexeme '$event_name' without a pause.
		Is:  Unexpected lexeme '$lexeme_name' with a pause.

1.01  Tue Jul 23 17:52:00 2013
	- Simplify the grammar and hence the code.

1.00  Mon Jul 15 09:22:00 2013
	  - Original version
